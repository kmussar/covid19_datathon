Please also see this series of maps visualizing the disparity of COVID-19 deaths by race. The data was visualized using Tableau and can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/kristin.mussar#!/vizhome/maps_of_disparity_state/White.

**Data Source:**
Data was collected and normalized by the CDC. It was downloaded on May 13, 2020 from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm

Importantly, the percentage of racial/ethnic groups per state population that is reported has been weighted. These weights ensure that the population estimates and percentage of COVID deaths represent comparable geographic areas. To see more details on how the weighted percentages were calculated, please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/tech_notes.htm

We defined the disparity score as the % COVID-19 deaths - % state's population for each race. We have created maps for the following races: 
* Black
* Asian
* Hispanic
* American Indian or Alaska Native 
* White 
* Other 

For details on how each race is defined, please see the CDC notes referenced above.
