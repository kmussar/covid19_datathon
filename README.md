# covid19_datathon
Group project in association with MIT's COVID-19 Datathon (https://covid19challenge.mit.edu/datathon/) 

The MIT COVID19-Datathon is an effort to understand the impact of COVID-19 across 5 different areas: 

* Measuring the Impact of Policies around COVID-19
* Misinformation during the Pandemic
* Disparities in Health Outcomes from COVID-19
* Epidemiology of COVID-19
* Megacity Pandemic Response in NYC 

There are approximately 400 active participants split across 5 tracks and further into teams fo 3-7 participants. Our team is focused on understanding disparities in health outcomes from COVID-19. The datathon organiziers describe this area of research as follows: 

COVID-19 is not the “great equalizer” that some may claim it to be, with preliminary data from the United States and other jurisdictions indicating that the burden of the pandemic is falling disproportionately upon certain marginalized groups. In this track, the goal is to perform data-driven analyses to characterize and understand the nature and magnitude of these disparities, as well as their structural and policy determinants. We will be analyzing datasets related to the prevalence of COVID-19 among different populations, the outcomes of cases in those populations, and structural determinants such as socio-economic status and food security.

**Specifically, we are working to understand:**

1. Are there disparities in outcomes for COVID-19 cases along racial, geographic, econonomic, gender, other lines?
and 
2. What is the connection between the geographical layout of the city and COVID-19 disparities? E.g. neighborhood-by-neighborhood differences?
